      <h5> Overview of my projects </h5>
      During the course of my PhD I have been involved in many projects related to the design and control of primarily
      aerial robots. I began my robotics career in the first year of my master degree at ECN, on a project studying the
      optimal design of cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) with Dr. Caro for a experimental platform he was planning
      to install in the LS2N lab. This project led to me to do my master thesis (in France this is a 6 month independant
      research project at the end of the MSc. degree) with Dr. Caro and Dr. Chriette studying flying cable-suspended
      parallel robots, which are effectively CDPRs with the actuators replaced by quadrotors. This was the beginning of
      my work in aerial robotics.
      <br><br>
      Directly after my MSc degree I began a PhD with Dr. Fantoni and Dr. Chriette, this time focusing on drone swarms.
      As the subject was open ended, I developped an interest in vision-based formation control and directed my thesis
      in this that direction. Much of my thesis is devoted to decentralized control laws allowing qroups of quadrotors
      to maintain themselves in formation using onboard visual measurements.
      Despite the seemingly disconnect between this and my original work in parallel robots, I began a collaboration with Dr. Briot, an expert in singularities of parallel robots to solve a more theoretical problem in formation control, that of degenerate cases of graph rigidity.
      <br><br>
      Thoughout my PhD, I have remained involved in many aspect of aerial robots outside of my own thesis. I spent much of my first year providing support to other PhD and masters students beginning on the drone platform, upgrading the experimental capabilities in our lab. I collaborated on numerous projects, including the continuation of my masters thesis, a the identification of quadrotor  dynamic parameters, and several aerial manipulation projects. These are grouped as specified below:

      <br>

      <h5> Multirotors :</h5>
      Since starting my master thesis, I have built several different multirotor platforms for use in both mine and
      others experiements. This page details the multirotors I built, along with work on identifying these platforms.
      <br>

      <h5> Swarms :</h5>
      This is the core of my PhD research on vision-based formation control. I detail the various control methods I use,
      as well as the more theoretical work on formation rigidity and its links with parallel robots.
      <br>

      <h5> Aerial Manipulators :</h5>
      The majority of my published work so far has been in the aerial manipulation domain. I began with cable suspended
      payloads from multiple quadrotors during my master thesis. I then continued this project, supervising a masters
      student who help me to extend this work by including winches on the quadrotors so that the cables were no longer
      of fixed length.
      <br>

      <h5> Cable Robots :</h5>
      While I have no publications or prototyping experience with these robots, they remain a topic of interest to me
      and were what launched my interest in robotics research. This page gives a quick overview of my first research
      prject in robotics.
