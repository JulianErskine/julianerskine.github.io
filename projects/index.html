			<h4>Project RAPID (PhD Thesis) <br>2018-2021</h4>
      <p> Description</p>
      Project RAPID is a research project mounted by Dr. Isabelle Fantoni at LS2N with the objective of improving formation flight in drone swarms. My work within the scope of this project followed two primary axes: 
      <ol>
        <li>Improving the control of dynamic vision-based drone formations</li>
        <li>Analysing singular cases of formation rigidity (i.e. special conditions where a formation is theoretically unable to maintain a specific geometry) </li>
      </ol>

      The control of vision-based formations is typically done through a spherical reprojection of image data, known as a bearing. The bearing gives an indication of the direction of one drone relative to another without an indication of the relative depth. I developped and implemented two control solutions: one based on second order visual servoing (SOVS), and one based on visual model predictive control (MPC) to increase the reactivity of these formations. The MPC implementation for visual formation flight was particularly successfull, achieving high accelerations in small volumes (outdoor experiments were not authorized).

      <br><br>
      For the analysis of bearing formation singularities, I worked with Dr. Sebastien Briot to develop a highly scaleable method for analysing the singularites of large bearing formations. We showed that the controller response to  inter-drone measurements can be expressed as an analogical set of mechanical constraints which may then be analysed through classical kinematic analysis tools such as screw theory.
    

			<p> Funding</p>
			Project RAPID was funded by the French region Pays de la Loire through the RFI AtlanSTIC project RAPID, by the Ecole Centrale de Nantes, and by the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada through a PGS-D scholarship.

			<h4>Aerial Cable Towed Systems (M.Sc Thesis) <br>2018-2019</h4>
      <p> Description</p>
      The objective of this research project was to
      <ol>
        <li>Develop and test a method for analysing the payload capacities of a system of quadrotors manipulating a suspended payload (ACTS) under static and dynamic conditions</li>
        <li>Build a prototype ACTS using open-source drone components</li>
        <li>Program a controller for the ACTS to experimentally validate the kinematic analysis</li>
      </ol>
      
      This work was successfully completed through the end of my Master thesis and the first several month of my PhD, leading to publications of both the theoretical and experimental results. The drone system I implemented was then extended to the majority of the drone-related projects in the laboratory.

      <h4>Cable-Driven Parallel Robots <br>2017</h4>
      
      <p> Description</p>
      This project was done in the scope of the ECN first year master project course under the supervision of Dr. Stephane Caro, with the goal of developing a MATLAB tool for the design of cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs).
