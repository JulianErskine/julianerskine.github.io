      <h5>Project RAPID (PhD Thesis)<br>2018-2021</h5>
      <h4> Description</h4>
      Project RAPID is a research project mounted by Dr. Isabelle Fantoni at LS2N with the objective of improving
      formation flight in drone swarms. My work within the scope of this project followed two primary axes:
      <ol>
        <li>Improving the control of dynamic vision-based drone formations</li>
        <li>Analysing singular cases of formation rigidity (i.e. special conditions where a formation is
          theoretically unable to maintain a specific geometry) </li>
      </ol>

      The control of vision-based formations is typically done through a spherical reprojection of image data, known
      as a bearing. The bearing gives an indication of the direction of one drone relative to another without an
      indication of the relative depth. I developped and implemented two control solutions: one based on second
      order visual servoing (SOVS), and one based on visual model predictive control (MPC) to increase the
      reactivity of these formations. The MPC implementation for visual formation flight was particularly
      successfull, achieving high accelerations in small volumes (outdoor experiments were not authorized).

      <br><br>
      For the analysis of bearing formation singularities, I worked with Dr. Sebastien Briot to develop a highly
      scaleable method for analysing the singularites of large bearing formations. We showed that the controller
      response to inter-drone measurements can be expressed as an analogical set of mechanical constraints which may
      then be analysed through classical kinematic analysis tools such as screw theory.


      <h4> Funding</h4>
      My thesis was funded by the French region Pays de la Loire through the RFI AtlanSTIC project RAPID, by the
      Ecole Centrale de Nantes, and by the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada through a
      PGS-D scholarship.
